abstract = {STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PSYCHOLOGY, 8E, International Edition surveys the statistical techniques commonly used in the behavioral and social sciences, particularly psychology and education. To help students gain a better understanding of the specific statistical hypothesis tests that are covered throughout the text, author David Howell emphasizes conceptual understanding. This Eighth Edition continues to focus students on two key themes that are the cornerstones of this book's success: the importance of looking at the data before beginning a hypothesis test, and the importance of knowing the relationship between the statistical test in use and the theoretical questions being asked by the experiment. New and expanded topics-reflecting the evolving realm of statistical methods-include effect size, meta-analysis, and treatment of missing data.},
